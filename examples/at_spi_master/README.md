# SPI master Examples

This section provides examples how the MCU communicates with SPI AT, there are two ways to do this, SDSPI mode and SPI mode. Due to the limitations of ESP32 SPI, SPI slave can only work within the frequency of 10M and SDIO SPI can be up to 40M.

See the [README.md](sdspi/README.md) file in the sdspi directory for more information about SDIO SPI.

See the [README.md](spi/esp32/README.md) file in the spi directory for more information about ESP32 SPI.
